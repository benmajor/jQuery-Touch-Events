# jQuery Touch Events


This is a series of plugins that create additional events that can be used in combination with jQuery when developing for mobile devices. The events are also compatible with desktop browsers to ensure ultimate compatibility for your projects. In time, we will update the Repository to include some very basic demonstrations to get you started with using the events, but for now, we've put together a list of the events that are provided, and what they do.

As explained, the events are each triggered by native touch events, or alternatively by click events. The plugin automatically detects whether the user's device is touch compatible, and will use the correct native events whenever required. It is hoped that these events will help to aid single-environment development with jQuery for mobile web app development.

## 2. Installation:


jQuery Touch Events, as the name suggests, require only the jQuery library (version 1.7+) to run. You should download the latest release from the `src` folder, and include the Javascript file within your project, **after** jQuery has been included. It is recommended to also wrap your code inside the `DOMReady` callback function of jQuery (`$(function() {  })`, for example). 

**Manual installation:**

Once you have downloaded the JS files from the master branch, you should include them using the following code:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/jquery.mobile-events.min.js"></script>
```

The awesome guys over at [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery-touch-events) have kindly added the library to their CDN so you can include it as follows directly into your application:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-touch-events/1.0.5/jquery.mobile-events.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, you can also install jQuery-touch-events using Bower as follows:

```
$ bower install jquery-touch-events
```

jQuery Touch Events can also be installed using NPM as follows:

```
$ npm i @benmajor/jquery-touch-events
```

If you are installing the library via NPM, after running the `npm i` command above, you'll also need to ensure that you import the modules into you project files wherever you wish to use the events. Place the following line alongside your other imports:

```js
import "@benmajor/jquery-touch-events";
```

### 3. Usage:
All of the events outlined above have been written using jQuery's ``event.special`` object, and so can be used in conjunction with jQuery's event handling functions, as well as shortcut wrappers. As a result, all of the events that are supported by this library may be handled using any of jQuery's own event-specific methods, such as `on()` and `one()`. 

The following code snippets showcase some basic usage with jQuery:

**Binding a ``tap`` event to an element:**  

When binding, you should use jQuery's `on()` function as follows (avoid the use of `live()` and `bind()` as these are now deprecated and will be removed from future versions of jQuery).

```js
$('#myElement').on('tap', function(e) { 
    console.log('User tapped #myElement'); 
});
```

**Triggering the event:**  
```js
$('#myElement').trigger('tap');
```

**Removing the event:**  
```js
$('#myElement').off('tap', handler);
```

**Using method wrapper:**  
```js
$('#myElement').tap(function(e) { 
    console.log('User tapped #myElement'); 
});
```

**Method chaining:**  
Chaining has also been preserved, so you can easily use these events in conjunction with other jQuery functions, or attach multiple events in a single, chained LOC:  
```js
$('#myElement').singletap(function() { 
    console.log('singletap');
}).doubletap(function() { 
    console.log('doubletap'); 
});
```


## 4. The Events:

+ **`tapstart`**  
Fired as soon as the user begins touching an element (or clicking, for desktop environments).
+ **`tapend`**  
Fired after the user releases their finger from the target element (or releases their mouse button on desktops).
+ **`tapmove`**  
Fired as soon as the user begins moving their finger on an element (or moving their mouse, for desktop environments).
+ **`tap`**  
This event is fired whenever the user taps and releases their finger on the target element. Caution should be observed when using this event in conjunction with tap events, especially ``doubletap``. This event will be fired twice when ``doubletap`` is used, so it is recommended to use ``singletap`` in this case.
+ **`singletap`**  
Unlike ``tap`` this event is only triggered once we are certain the user has only tapped the target element a single time. This will not be triggered by ``doubletap`` or ``taphold``, unlike ``tap``. Since we need to run some tests to make sure the user isn't double tapping or holding a tap on the target element, this event is fired with a short delay (currently of 500 milliseconds).
+ **`doubletap`**  
Triggered whenever the user double taps on the target element. The threshold (time between taps) is currently set at 500 milliseconds.
+ **`taphold`**  
This event is triggered whenever the user taps on the target element and leaves their finger on the element for at least *750 milliseconds*.
+ **`swipe`**  
This is called whenever the user swipes their finger on the target element. It is not direction-dependent, and is fired regardless of the direction the user swiped.
+ **`swipeup`**  
Similar to ``swipe``, except only called when the user swipes their finger in an upward direction on the target element (i.e. bottom to top)
+ **`swiperight`**  
Similar to ``swipe``, but triggered only when the user swipes their finger left to right on the target element.
+ **`swipedown`**  
Similar to ``swipe``, but triggered only when the user swipes their finger top to bottom on the target element.
+ **`swipeleft`**  
Similar to ``swipe``, but triggered only when the user swipes their finger from right to left.
+ **`swipeend`**  
The ``swipeend`` event is trigged whenever a swipe event ends (i.e. the user finished moving their finger / cursor and released it). This event should be used to handle custom functions, since it will be triggered only when the swipe ends, rather than triggering immediately when the threshold has been met. 
+ **`scrollstart`**  
Triggered as soon as scrolling begins on the target element.
+ **`scrollend`**  
Triggered as soon as scrolling is stopped on the target element.
+ **`orientationchange`**  
This event is triggered when the orientation of the device is changed. Please note that it uses throttling for non-mobile devices, or devices which do not support the native ``orientationchange`` event. In the latter instance, a detection of the viewport size change occurs.


## 5. Callback Data:
Each event now features a second argument that can be passed to the specified callback function. This argument includes some basic data relating specifically to the event, and can be accessed as a standard JavaScript object. To hook into this parameter, you should use the following code:

```js
$(element).swipeend(function(e, touch) {  });
```

Given the example above, `touch` will now contain some basic data that can be accessed through `touch.`. The first argument will represent the last *native* event that occurred (the names used for these two arguments is irrelevant).

Each event provides different callback data. The following shows the numerous data that are passed back to the callback function inside the second parameter:

### `tapstart`, `tapend`, `tapmove`, `tap`, `singletap`:

`offset` - object containing the X and Y positions of the event relative to the element to which is was bound. Accessed through `offset.x` and `offset.y` respectively.

`position` - object containing the X and Y positions of the event relative to the screen. Accessed through `position.x` and `position.y` respectively.

`target` - the jQuery object from which the event was triggered.

`time` - JavaScript timestamp the event occurred (milliseconds since the Unix Epoch)

### `taphold`:

`duration`: the time in milliseconds that the user tapped for.

`endOffset` - object containing the X and Y positions of the end event (i.e. when the user released their finger or mouse) relative to the element to which the event was bound. Accessed through `endOffset.x` and `endOffset.y` respectively.

`endPosition` - object containing the X and Y positions of the end event (i.e. when the user released their finger or mouse) relative to the screen. Accessed through `endPosition.x` and `endPosition.y` respectively.

`endTime` - JavaScript timestamp the `taphold` was triggered (milliseconds since the Unix Epoch). This will ordinarily be equal to the `startTime` + `taphold` threshold.

`startOffset` - object containing the X and Y positions of the start event (i.e. when the user pressed their finger or mouse) relative to the element to which the event was bound. Accessed through `endOffset.x` and `endOffset.y` respectively.

`startPosition` - object containing the X and Y positions of the start event (i.e. when the user pressed their finger or mouse) relative to the screen. Accessed through `endPosition.x` and `endPosition.y` respectively.

`startTime` - JavaScript timestamp the `taphold` started (milliseconds since the Unix Epoch). 

`target` - the jQuery object from which the event was triggered.

### `doubletap`:

`firstTap` - Object containing the same data as a `tap` event, but for the first tap to occur.

`secondTap` - Object containing the same data as a `tap` event, but for the second (i.e. final) tap to occur.

`interval` - the time in milliseconds between the two tap.

### `swipe`, `swipeup`, `swiperight`, `swipedown`, `swipeleft`, `swipeend`:

`direction` - string representing the swipe direction (either `up`, `right`, `down` or `left`).

`duration` - the time in milliseconds over which the swipe took place (for best results, use with `swipeend` only, as this will typically be equal to the defined `swipe-threshold`.

`xAmount` - number of pixels the swipe occupied on the X-axis (returned regardless of direction).

`yAmount` - number of pixels the swipe occupied on the Y-axis (returned regardless of direction).

`startEvnt` - Object containing the same data as a `tap` event, but captured when swiping begins.

`endEvent` - Object containing the same data as a `tap` event, but captured when swiping is complete.

## 6. Defining Thresholds:

You can also define custom thresholds to be used for ``swipe`` events (``swipeup``, ``swiperight``, ``swipedown`` and ``swipeleft``) to prevent interference with scrolling and other events. To do so, simply assign a `data-xthreshold` or `data-ythreshold` to the target element as follows:

``<div id="mySwiper" data-xthreshold="500"></div>``

The value you define is the difference in pixels that the user must move before the event is triggered on the target element. If no threshold is defined, a default of `50px` will be used. 

``data-xthreshold`` defines the horizontal threshold.

``data-ythreshold`` defines the vertical threshold.

**Update as of 1.0.7:**
Following requests from users and contributors, as of 1.0.7 it is now possible to also define the `doubletap` threshold via jQuery's `data-` attributes as follows:

``data-threshold`` defines the amount of time (in milliseconds) after which the `doubletap` event is fired on the target element.

## 7. Utility Functions:

In addition to the numerous additional events that are provided, the library also includes a number of utility functions that can be used to further leverage the power of native events within your website or application. These utility functions can be used for unifying basic events, such as `tapstart` or `mousedown`.

The following utility functions are provided (each function is registered to the jQuery namespace, and should be called with `$.funcName()` (or `jQuery.funcName()` for compatibility):

+ `isTouchCapable()`:  
Returns `true` or `false` depending upon whether touch events are supported.
+ `getStartEvent()`:   
Returns `touchstart` for touch-enabled devices, or `mousedown` for standard environments.
+ `getEndEvent()`:  
Returns `touchend` for touch-enabled devices, or `mouseup` for standard environments.
+ `getMoveEvent()`:  
Returns `touchmove` for touch-enabled devices, or `mousemove` for standard environments.
+ `getTapEvent()`:  
Returns `tap` for touch-enabled devices, or `click` for standard environments.
+ `getScrollEvent()`:  
Returns `touchmove` for touch-enabled devices, or `scroll` for standard environments. **Caution should be exercised when using this function, since some mobile browsers will correctly bind to `scroll` as well as `touchmove`.**

## 8. Demo:

I have put together a simple demo application that shows the numerous events in action. The console on the left hand side is used to show information about the events that have been called. You can examine the code easily by viewing the page's source to lear more about how this works. Please click on the below to check out the demo:

http://lincweb.co.uk/labs/jquery-touch-events/demo/

Please be aware that this demonstration uses Google's hosted jQuery file, and also pulls the latest version of the events library from GitHub. It is a great place to check the status of the library. Since this demo uses the vanilla code, it is a good idea to check the library functionality here for your own reference. If you're running into problems with the library, please check this demonstration using your device in the first instance. You can scan in the QR below to go directly to the web page:
